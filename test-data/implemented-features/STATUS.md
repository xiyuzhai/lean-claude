# Test Data Status

## Current State
As of the latest update, the test-data files in this directory are being systematically fixed to be valid Lean4 code that compiles without errors.

## Fixed Files
✅ **Syntax.Expressions.Application** - Function application examples
✅ **Syntax.Expressions.LetHave** - Let and have expressions  
✅ **Syntax.Commands.Definitions** - Definition command examples
✅ **Syntax.Prelude** - Common definitions and helper functions

## Files Still Needing Fixes
❌ Most other files still contain syntax errors or undefined identifiers

## Problem Statement
The original test-data files contained numerous issues:
- Undefined identifiers (variables, functions, types)
- Missing type annotations
- Syntax errors
- Use of unimplemented Lean4 features

## Goal
All files in this directory should:
1. Compile successfully with `lake build`
2. Contain valid Lean4 syntax
3. Serve as test cases for our Rust parser implementation

## Progress
- **3/48 files** are currently compiling successfully
- **CI updated** to require `lake build` to pass before testing our parser
- **Systematic approach** being used to fix files one by one

## Next Steps
1. Continue fixing remaining files
2. Focus on core language features first
3. Add more comprehensive test cases
4. Test our parser against the validated files
